				"description": "Well-Being and Healing Through Singing We sing because itâ\u20ac™s empowering, we sing because itâ\u20ac™s healing, we sing because itâ\u20ac™s relaxing, we sing because it cleanses, we sing to boost our immune systems, we sing because it brings us closer, we sing for our world and our planet, we sing because itâ\u20ac™s fun, we sing to love deeper and we sing because it connects us to source. In these magical interactive sessions Lorrayn will lead Chants inspired by her Kundalini Yoga practice and some of the beautiful, simple, easy to learn Folk and Gospel songs from her teaching practice. I invite you to come and sing the beautiful Chants and Spiritual Songs I have gathered after 30 years of leading voice/singing/choir groups/workshops/classes of all kinds. Many of the chants are taken from my Kundalini Yoga practise, others are from other chanting traditions I have practised, some I have written myself and we also sing some Gospel songs.Â  Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Aim Is Always the Same â\u20ac\u201c To Connect to SOURCE Â If you are a singer, then you are welcome to join in and if not then you are very welcome to come and just listen to the music we will be creating. There is no compulsion to join in. Many people come just to experience the spiritual vibration of the chants and feel the comradery of being with like-minded people. Every person present contributes their own unique energy to the gathering even if you donâ\u20ac™t sing. However, the more singers the better. I will teach you the chants and songs. It would be true to say that all the songs have a strong spiritual component. The Vibration of The Sound -The Inspiration of The Melody and The Lyric Having a regular spiritual practice of our own (even if it is unstructured to start with like regular walks in nature, painting or yoga etc) and chanting especially can help create a powerful aura around us and stop another peopleâ\u20ac™s negativity sticking to us. It is something that needs to be PRACTISED on a regular basis. In the same way that we practice eating well and exercising to maintain physical fitness, spiritual fitness also needs to be practiced.Â Chanting is a spiritual practise and my aim is for us to transmit that healing energy to ourselves, to each other and out into the world through the music. Â  Lorrayn de Peyer is a professional singer with twenty-five yearsâ\u20ac™ experience leading singing groups, workshops and choirs; and over thirty years of practicing yoga and meditation. She is the founder and Director of THE COURAGE TO SING a national school of voice and singing. Â  Sacred singing can also be used for sacred occasions to uplift people at events of heightened emotion like births, deaths, times of grief or suffering as well as times of special celebrations. Perhaps some of you know occasions where we can go and sing to ease peoples pain or add to their celebration.

				"description": "After almost 15 years, British post-rock heroes Her Name Is Calla are calling it a day. Portals are proud to present their final UK show, at the Boston Music Room, on Saturday 4th May, with support from Katie Malco. The band have brought elements of folk storytelling and classical instrumentation to an otherwise codified genre and have always been hard to place. Nevertheless, their captivating records and live sets have drawn praise from all quarters of the music press: the NME described them as &quot;massive, pastorally apocalyptic music&quot;, whilst Drowned in Sound called them &quot;one of the most daring, unconventional bands the UK has to offer&quot;, and their album &#39;The Quiet Lamb&#39; currently ranks as the 16th best post-rock album of all-time according to a fans poll. Safe to say they will be sorely missed. The band will play an extended set in an intimate venue so as to play songs from all their albums. A special evening beckons.",
